# Whisper

A webapp built with FAST api and python. It converts input taken from an HTML form and then adds it a json file. The json file can then be read to search for input, by the keys added during the entry of the data. 
Download the repo and paste "uvicorn main:app --reload" in the terminal to run the program on the localhost.
